# Voronoify

A tiny, client‑side web app (ideal for GitHub Pages) that lets you generate and export a Voronoi diagram over a provided image. Drop in a picture, tweak a few parameters (number of points, relaxation, color mode, outlines), and export the result as a PNG or SVG.

No server is required — all processing happens in your browser.


## What this is
- An interactive playground to stylize images with Voronoi tessellation.
- A simple way to explore how the number and placement of generators (sites) affect the look.
- A single‑page app intended to be hosted via GitHub Pages.
