# Voronoify

Voronoify is a lightweight, client-side playground for dropping points on top of an uploaded image, panning/zooming, tweaking styles, and exporting either the raw site data (JSON array) or a rendered Voronoi overlay image.

## What it does

- Upload an image and see it on the canvas.
- Drop points, pan, and zoom to place them precisely.
- Style the grid/axes/lines to your liking.
- Export the point data as JSON or save a PNG with the Voronoi overlay sized to your image.
